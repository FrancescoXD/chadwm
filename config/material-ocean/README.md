### Introduction

This is my own effort to create a color scheme that doesn't blind by being too
dark or too light and not solarized. I found this color (`0f111a`) for the first
time on material theme for Vscode, so i copied the main color and added other
colors gradually until here we are, currently anything that uses Xresources can
use these colors, and there are many other apps themed as well.
